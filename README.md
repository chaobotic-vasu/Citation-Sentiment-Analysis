_"Sentiments behind citations: Tracking the need, current work and future directions of Citation Sentiment Analysis."_

This is a study of the importance of sentiment analysis for qualitative evaluation of Citations. With my colleague, published this survey paper in the SIET conference, 2017 in Indonesia. We took this as a independent and then, a minor research project in my B.Tech. Here's a copy. Hope it interests you. Have fun reading! There's also a ppt attached for convenience.
